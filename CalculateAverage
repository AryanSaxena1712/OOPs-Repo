Problem Statement:
Print the average of three numbers entered by user by creating a class named 'Average'having a method to calculate and print the average.

Solution:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Average{
    int a,b,c;
    
public:
    Average(){
        int x,y,z;
        cout<<"Enter first element:";
        cin>>x;
        cout<<"Enter second element:";
        cin>>y;
        cout<<"Enter third element:";
        cin>>z;


        this->a=x;
        this->b=y;
        this->c=z;
    }

    void calculateAvg(){
        float k=(float)(a+b+c)/3;
        cout<<"Average of the given numbers is "<<k;
    }
};

int main(){
    Average av;
    av.calculateAvg();
    return 0;
}


//Explanation:
In the above code I have created a class named 'Average' having three member variables as 'a','b' and 'c', no arguments are passed to the constructor since we need to take input from user,
therefore I have taken three temporary variables namely 'x,y and z' which will be used to take input from user and will assign values to member variables of the class.
The 'calculateAvg' function is a void type function with no arguments, this is used to calculate and print the average of the user provided values.
Since 'calculateAvg' is a void type function hence it will not return any value.
In the main function we create an object 'av' of class average, and using this object we call the 'calculateAvg' function.
