//Problem Statement:
Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and printthe final salary.
 1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
 2 - 'AddSal()'   which   adds   $10   to   salary   of   the   employee if it is less than $500.
 3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.

//Solution:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee{
    int salary,hrsPerDay;

public:
    void getInfo(int sal,int hrs){
        this->salary=sal;
        this->hrsPerDay=hrs;
    }

    void AddSal(){
        if(salary<500) salary+=10;
    }

    void AddWork(){
        if(hrsPerDay>6) salary+=5;
    }

    void printFinalSal(){
        cout<<"The final salary of the employee is $:"<<salary;
    }
};

int main(){
    Employee ep;
    ep.getInfo(100,7);
    ep.AddSal();
    ep.AddWork();
    ep.printFinalSal();
    return 0;
}

//Explanation:
In the above code I have create an 'Employee' class which has private instance variables as 'salary' and 'hrsPerDay' denoting salary and no of hours of work per day of
an individual, public member functions as 'getInfo' which acts as a constructor for setting values of instance variables, 'AddSal' which adds $10 to salary if salary of
an employee is less than $500, 'AddWork' which adds $5 to salary if the number of woking hours of an employee exceeds 6 hours a day.
I have used a public memeber function 'printFinalSal' to display the private instance variable 'salary'.
